## What we are building
- We are planning to build a movie ticket purchasing website.
- Users will be able to select which movie they want to watch the time and the seat.
- This website will be for a small single theatre that shows movies at different times.
- There will be different tiers of seats with different costs.

**Design**
- The website should focus on a mobile-first approach.
- The website will specify which seats are available and which seats are unavailable or restricted (for example, accessible seating).
- The website will display a mobile-friendly map of the theatre/seating that scales responsively to larger screens.
- The website will list all and any features of the selected movie screening, such as IMAX visuals.

**Error Handling**
- Users will not be able to place an order with 0 (or less) tickets.
- Users will not be able to purchase tickets for movies that occurred in the past.
- When placing an order, the form must verify that the information entered by the user is valid. This includes (but is not limited to) names, addresses, contact information, and payment information.

**Ideas**
- Utilize 3rd party sources such as Rotten Tomatoes to enhance content.
